# PhysioTrack
Capstone Project by: Anusha Dey, Sweta Ramamani, Elodie Xie, Emma Rehders

## Based on the MetaROM App source code for iOS/macOS/tvOS/watchOS by MBIENTLAB
(https://github.com/mbientlab/MetaWear-iOS-MetaROM-App)

To build:
`brew install cocoapods` - run cocoapods to check installed
`git clone --recurse-submodules [this repo]` , otherwise install cpp submodule separately. regular clone may complain about missing Cpp import
`pod update`

run from `MetaRom.xcworkspace`
When testing, set all build settings to iOS of device you're testing.
